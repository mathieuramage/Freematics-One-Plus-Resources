# Freematics One+ Resources

Welcome to the Freematics One+ Resources repository! This repository is a collection of my learnings and explorations as I progress in understanding and mastering the Freematics One+ device. Here, you'll find useful code examples, guides, and resources for working with vehicle data, telematics, and OBD-II interfaces.

## Overview

The Freematics One+ is a powerful Arduino-compatible device designed for vehicle telematics prototyping. It provides access to vehicle data via OBD-II, CAN bus sniffing, WiFi, Bluetooth, motion detection, GPS, and more. With its ESP32-based architecture, the device supports real-time data processing, making it ideal for projects that involve connected vehicles and smart car applications.

## What You'll Find Here

This repository includes:

- **Code Examples**: Arduino sketches that show how to use the Freematics One+ for common use cases, such as:
  - Reading OBD-II parameters like speed and engine RPM.
  - Sniffing CAN bus messages.
  - Logging GPS coordinates and vehicle data.
- **Guides and Documentation**: Step-by-step guides to help set up, configure, and program the Freematics One+ device.
- **Resources for Integration**: Information and examples for integrating the device with telemetry systems, mobile apps, and cloud services.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need:

1. A Freematics One+ device.
2. A compatible vehicle with an OBD-II port.
3. The Arduino IDE or PlatformIO for programming the device.

Refer to the [Getting Started Guide](./guides/getting_started.md) to learn how to set up your device and begin programming it.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you've found something interesting or have a useful code snippet, fix, or guide you'd like to share, please feel free to open a pull request. Let's work together to explore and make vehicle telematics more accessible for everyone.
